Several data sources from the zipped dataset were used in this cleansing process.

Original source:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

File 1:
./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt
This file was used to translate activity_id to activity_name.  Six lines.

File 2:
./UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt
This file was used to provide the features of the train_set and test_set data sets, in other words, the column names.  They are presumed to be in the correct order.

File 3: 
./UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt
This file was used as the core of the training set.  It contains normalized numeric readings for several measurements.

File 4:
./UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt
This file contains the labels for the training data, in other words, the activity_id for what the subject was doing during each reading.

File 5:
./UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt
This file contains the subjects (by subject_id) for each line of the training data.

File 6:
./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt
Core data of test set, similar to File 3

File 7:
./UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt
Labels for test data.  Similar to File 4

File 8:
./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt
Subject_ids for test data.  Similar to File 5



For each set of data (train and test):
1) Columns of data set were named based on the features.txt data
2) Labels (activity_id) were attached to data set
3) Labels were translated from activity_id to activity_name
4) Subject_id's were attached to the data set

Then the two data sets were appended together.

The combined data set was stripped of all numeric columns which did not contain "mean" or "std" in the columnn name.

The resulting data set was split on activity_name and subject_id, means of all numeric values computed for each resulting set, and the results coerced back into a training set.

This final data frame is what is returned by calling run_analysis()
